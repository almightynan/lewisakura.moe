            ...and nice to meet you! I'm Lewis (but you can also call me Lewi), a software engineer &mdash; primarily
            backend &mdash; and an aspiring content creator. I currently mostly write projects for my own personal use,
            as part of teams, or as commissions for freelance.

                Nice to see your curiosity! <span id="age">I was 18 years old when this site was last updated</span>,
                and I have a huge interest in technology. Whilst software engineering is my passion and my major, I've
                dabbled in network engineering and cybersecurity. They're really fun topics, so I'm very passionate
                about all three!
            </p>
            <p>
                I really like designing pretty websites, but actually implementing them is a problem for me. I've
                unfortunately had to throw away projects because of it mainly because they were web design heavy or they
                depended on public usage. However, some projects I've been able to keep because of being in teams! I
                really like working in teams of people since it helps me distribute the workload and I can focus on my
                strengths, which is usually engineering backend technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also a game developer, primarily working on the Roblox platform. Despite the surrounding stigma, I
                think it's a great platform for learning, and I've had a lot of fun working on it. I've also used Unity,
                Unreal, and Godot.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of being a content creator, I have always had an interest in providing entertainment to people.
                One day, when I have a bit of money to spare, I'd like to invest in becoming a VTuber &ndash; I have a
                character already, just not the money to bring it into existence. From there, depending on how it goes,
                I might focus completely on content creation and move my engineering work to the side. Of course, I'd
                still partake in programming, it has been my life after all, but I'd like to focus more on entertaining
                people and making them happy. I love seeing people smile.
            </p>
            <p>My name is Lewis Crichton. That's my full name.</p>

            There is quite a bit here, so I'll drop it in another one of the collapsible things and you can check it out
            if you want! I'll try to keep it up to date as possible. Personal projects are not listed and you can find
            them on my GitHub (in the footer).
        </p>
        <p>
            You may notice a lot of these are short-term jobs. A few of these were only a couple of months or were
            one-shot placements, and also for the most part were volunteer work. For transparency, I have indicated paid
            positions with üí∏.

                        include them, either because I have forgotten the exact details and I don't currently have notes
                        of them due to them being very old, or because I do not believe they are relevant enough to earn
                        a placement on this page. Current placements may also fall under this, but I am not active
                        enough in them to warrant a placement here.

        <div id="funFacts">
            Here's some quickfire fun facts about this website:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The CSS is a derivative of the excellent
                    <a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura">sakura.css</a> framework. I wrote the CSS myself, but
                    the majority is based on this and sometimes is even verbatim. It's a wonderful framework, you should
                    check it out!
                </li>
                <li>I wrote this in approximately 2 hours.</li>
                <li>
                    Shiki (the code highlighter on this site) is mainly a build-time tool, but I wrote some very awful
                    JavaScript to get it to work at runtime. Please do not look at the source, it's very overengineered
                    and I'll throw it away someday.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Speaking of build-time tools, there are none here. I manually wrote all the HTML because I'm a
                    masochist and I haven't futureproofed this at all.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The monospace font is <a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a> (specifically the web
                    variant), and everything else is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">Inter</a>, unless
                    of course none of it loaded.
                </li>
