            ...and nice to meet you! I'm Lewis (but you can also call me Lewi), a software engineer &mdash; primarily
            backend &mdash; and I exist! I currently mostly write projects for my own personal use, as part of teams, or
            as commissions for freelance.
        </p>

                Nice to see your curiosity! I was 18 the last time this site was updated, and I have a huge interest in
                technology. Whilst software engineering is my passion and my major, I've dabbled in network engineering
                and cybersecurity. They're really fun topics, so I'm very passionate about all three!
            </p>
            <p>
                I really like designing pretty websites, but actually implementing them is a problem for me. I've
                unfortunately had to throw away projects because of it mainly because they were web design heavy or they
                depended on public usage. However, some projects I've been able to keep because of being in teams! I
                really like working in teams of people since it helps me distribute the workload and I can focus on my
                strengths, which is usually engineering backend technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also a game developer, primarily working on the Roblox platform. Despite the stigma around it, I
                think it's a great platform for learning and I've had a lot of fun working on it. I've also used Unity,
                Unreal, and Godot.

        <div id="funFacts">
            Here's some quickfire fun facts about this website:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The CSS is a derivative of the excellent
                    <a href="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura">sakura.css</a> framework. I wrote the CSS myself, but
                    the majority is based on this and sometimes is even verbatim. It's a wonderful framework, you should
                    check it out!
                </li>
                <li>I wrote this in approximately 2 hours.</li>
                <li>
                    Shiki (the code highlighter on this site) is mainly a build-time tool, but I wrote some very awful
                    JavaScript to get it to work at runtime. Please do not look at the source, it's very overengineered
                    and I'll throw it away someday.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Speaking of build-time tools, there are none here. I manually wrote all the HTML because I'm a
                    masochist and I haven't futureproofed this at all.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The monospace font is <a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a> (specifically the web
                    variant), and everything else is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">Inter</a>, unless
                    of course none of it loaded.
                </li>
            </ul>
