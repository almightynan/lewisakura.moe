Our first lines of code that we ever write, Hello World has been our most common goto for writing. It's also an expression used
to announce your presence to the outside world that you exist. Here's me doing just that.

Hi, I'm `LewisTehMinerz`. I'm a developer. You will find me here and on Discord, which is my primary social media application
that I use. Most services I use I register under the same username so it's always relatively easy to find me somewhere.

Anyways, I'm not sure what I'm going to be writing about yet. Probably just random things that I decide to do.

You can [read more about me](/) if you wish.

I'll see you around.
