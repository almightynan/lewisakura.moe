import Tag from "../../components/Tag.astro";

I've converted my site to use Astro! Ain't that nifty?

If you don't know what Astro is yet.. what rock are you living under? Go [check it out](https://astro.build/), and then
come back.

You done? Good.

So, I decided to rebuild it because ~~everyone else had a prettier website~~ I thought it was time to kill off my
shortly-lived handwritten site and just move to a build tool. It can do it better than me, it can optimize away most of
my unnecessary font files, and better yet it allows me to make blog posts!

Also, I can finally get rid of runtime Shiki. Look at this generated at build time codeblock:

```javascript
console.log("hello world!");
```

...and it still looks just as good!

Also, with this, I've introduced a new comment system on Giscus (scroll all the way down to check it out) which allows
you to react to posts and comment on them. This is basically like my old blog, but way cooler. Speaking of, I have
migrated all of my old posts here, where you can read them, and I've tagged them with <Tag tag="archive"/>.

Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the new site! I'll be adding more features as I go along, and I'll be adding more posts as I
write them.

See ya.
